# Terminally Online Typescript Template

This is a template repository for a Typescript project that prepares the base of a new project. As some things should be constant through all repos, this template is meant to be used as your starting point. However, feel free to make adjustments where necessary.

## Dependencies

Anything installed should be managed with `pnpm`. We do not mix the use of `npm` or `yarn` in this repository.
